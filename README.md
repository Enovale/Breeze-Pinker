 Breeze Darker
 
 If you like Breeze Dark but wish it was just a little darker with a GTK theme to match that darkness. This is just a little darker so it is not too dark but in my eyes just right. I like Breeze Dark but have always wished it was just a little darker so I made it that way for myself and decided to share. The GTK theme matches perfectly. I use Arch so this is built from the latest Breeze Dark color scheme.
